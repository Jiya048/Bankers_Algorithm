# Bankers_Algorithm
The banker’s algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm that tests for safety by simulating the allocation for the predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, then makes an “safe-state” check to test for possible activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.
